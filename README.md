#**Python:**

Ensure you have Python 3.7+ installed. Install the following libraries aiohttp, asyncpg, temporalio and novu
Command

> pip install aiohttp asyncpg temporalio novu 

#**PostgreSQL:**

Ensure you have a PostgreSQL database named temporal and a table news_articles with the following schema:
CREATE TABLE news_articles ( id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, title TEXT, published_at TIMESTAMPTZ, description TEXT, content TEXT);

#**Novu Account:**

Sign up for a novu account and obtain an API key and steup the trigger and workflow.


#**Code process:**

##**activities.py :** 

Fetches news articles from the News API.

##**workflows.py:** 

Workflow that triggers the fetch news activity and returns the result.

##**run_workflows.py:** 

Contains the functions for insert, fetch, delete, and update articles in the database and send the articles via email notification using the send grid library.

**insert_articles(articles[0:10])**  this inserts only 10 articles
**delete_all_articles()** this delete all the rows from the news_articles table
**update_article()** this updates the content based on the id of the article
**fetch_articles()** this retrieves all the articles from the news_articles table 
**send_email(content)** this sends an email using send grid library with the fetched articles. It takes the subject of the mail and content as the argument.

##**run_worker.py:**

This executes the code of workflows and activity  

#**Brief Explanation**

First I got the understanding how temporal work. I was trying to run the quick start code but was it was not running then I solved the problem by running the temporal server using docker. Once the say hello code got successfully executed. I gone through the complete code but it was going all over my head so, I found they have listed some banker example code and community post.

After reading the codes thoroughly and itâ€™s explanation I got a hand how the structure is and where should I put my code blocks so that it can run efficiently. I created a branch from main as version_0.1 in this I just fetched the raw data and printed it then I formatted it and got the things I want which were title, published_at, description and content. Once the formatting was in place I also tried printing it just to make sure everything was correct and then pushed the code and created a pull request and merge it with main.
Now I checked out on the version_0.1 to main then created a new branch version_0.2 in which I wanted the add the SQL operation part I created the function one by one and tested them they all worked perfectly as I wanted. Then I committed the code and pushed to create a pull request then merged it with main.

Now on version0.3 we have the email notification in place. User gets the news articles(needs to be formatted before sending) in the mail.

#**Challenges**

Running temporal first time solved the problem by following some community posts and official documentation.
Email notification was sending empty body so edited the worflow with custom variable in using the custom code section
